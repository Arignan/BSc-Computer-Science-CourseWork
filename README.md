  <h1>Computer Science</h1>

  <p>Welcome to my Computer Science corner! This page provides an overview of my University coursework, projects, interests, and contributions in the field of computer science.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm passionate about computer science incontrast software development, artificial intelligence, web development, etc. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems.</p>

  <h2>Terms of BSc </h2>

  <p>Here are Main 3 Terms:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Arignan/BSc-Computer-Science-CourseWork/tree/main/Year%201%20(Part%20IA)/1.Preparation%20for%20Computer%20Science">Year 1 (Part IA)</a>: </li>
      <p>[You take 4 papers, including 3 compulsory Computer Science papers, covering topics such as:]</p>
      <ul>
    	<li>foundations of computer science, taught in OCaml</li>
    	<li>Java and object-oriented programming</li>
    	<li>operating systems</li>
    	<li>digital electronics</li>
    	<li>graphics</li>
    	<li>interaction design</li>
    	<li>machine learning</li>
     </ul>
     <p>You will also take a Mathematics paper, from the first year of the Natural Sciences course.</p>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Arignan/BSc-Computer-Science-CourseWork/tree/main/Year%202%20(Part%20IB)">Year 2 (Part IB)</a>:</li>
      <p>[You take 4 papers, spanning core topics:]</p>
